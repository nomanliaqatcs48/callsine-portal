        <strong>18. Mediation Agreement and Class Action Waiver</strong>
      </p>

      <Box className="tw-ml-[10px]">
        <p>
          <strong>A. Mandatory Mediation.</strong> IN THE EVENT ANY DISPUTES
          SHOULD ARISE OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES (each, a
          “Dispute”) YOU AND CALLSINE AGREE, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, TO RESOLVE
          SUCH DISPUTES BY WAY OF Non-Binding Mediation pursuant to the laws and
          procedure of the State of New Hampshire which shall govern the
          interpretation and enforcement of any Mediation agreement (“Mediation
          Agreement”). You acknowledge and understand that you and CallSine
          waive the right to a trial by jury and any right to have a Dispute
          heard in court in the first instance. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
          both you and CallSine retain the right to bring an individual action
          in small claims court (if your claims qualify and so long as the
          matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual
          (non-class, non-representative) basis) and the right to seek
          injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
          jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
          misappropriation, or violation of either party’s copyrights,
          trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
          rights, whether registered, unregistered, pending or granted.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Mediation, Disputes are resolved with the assistance of a single
          and neutral mediator agreed upon by the parties instead of a judge or
          jury, discovery may be more limited than in court, and the mediator's
          recommendation may be subject to limited review by courts. The
          mediator can recommend on an individual basis the payment of similar
          damages and relief as a court. Judgment on the mediated agreement
          between parties may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
          thereof. The Mediation shall be conducted in Rockingham County, State
          of New Hampshire or any other mutually agreed upon location, provided
          that if the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or
          CallSine may elect to have the Mediation conducted by telephone, video
          conferencing such as WebEx or Zoom, or based solely on written
          submissions, with said election being binding on you and CallSine,
          subject to the mediator’s discretion to require an in-person mediation
          , if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person mediation
          is held, you or CallSine may attend by telephone or video
          conferencing, unless the mediator requires otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>B. Mediation Class Action Waiver.</strong> You and CallSine
          agree that the Mediation will be conducted solely on an individual
          basis and not on a class, representative, consolidated, or private
          attorney general basis. A Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim
          brought or discovery by any person or entity that is not a party to
          the Mediation proceeding. The mediator may not recommend relief to any
          person or entity other than a party to the Mediation proceeding and
          may only recommend such relief as is necessary to provide relief to a
          party to the Mediation proceeding. If a court deems any portion of
          this Section B invalid or unenforceable, then Sections A and C of this
          Mediation Agreement shall be null and void.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>C. Fees and Costs in Mediation.</strong> The parties agree
          that they shall share equally in the costs of Mediation. However, in
          the event the neutral Mediator should find bad faith on the part of
          either party, that party shall be responsible for the payment of all
          Mediation costs. Payment of all filing, administration and mediator
          fees will be governed by the relevant procedure and laws of the State
          of New Hampshire.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>D. Non-Mediation Class Action and Jury Waiver.</strong> You
          and CallSine agree that if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court
          rather than Mediation: (1) you and CallSine waive any right to a jury
          trial; (2) the Dispute will proceed solely on an individual,
          non-class, non-representative basis; and (3) neither you nor CallSine
          may be a class representative or class member or otherwise participate
          in any class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney
          general proceeding.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            E. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS SECTION, YOU MAY
            CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY MEDIATION IF YOU OPT
            OUT OF THIS MEDIATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE EARLIER OF:
            (1) THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR (2) THE DATE YOU FIRST
            AGREED OR ASSENTED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH CALLSINE THAT CONTAINED AN
            MEDIATION PROVISION.
          </strong>{" "}
          The opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than the applicable
          deadline and mailed to: CallSine LLC, 44 Lafayette Rd., PO Box 263,
          North Hampton, NH 03862. The opt-out notice must state that you do not
          agree to this Mediation Agreement and must include your name, address,
          phone number and email address. This procedure is the only way you can
          opt out of this Mediation Agreement, and failure to comply strictly
          with this procedure and the applicable deadline automatically will
          render the opt-out notice null and void. If you opt out of the
          Mediation provision, all other parts of this Mediation Agreement will
          continue to apply.

        <p>
          <strong>A. Injunctive Relief -</strong> You agree and acknowledge that
          any access, use, disclosure, retention or other processing of CallSine
          Data in violation of these Terms may cause immediate and irreparable
          harm to CallSine for which money damages may not constitute an
          adequate remedy. Therefore, you agree that CallSine may obtain
          specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, in
          addition to its remedies at law. CallSine shall be entitled to such
          equitable relief in addition to all other remedies at law or in
          equity.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>B. Choice of Law and Venue -</strong> This Agreement, the

          mediation, litigation, controversies, hearings, charges, complaints or

          herewith, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          procedural and substantive laws of the State of New Hampshire, without
          giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that
          would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The
          parties agree that any action to enforce the provisions of this
          Agreement will take place in New Hampshire, and the parties expressly
          agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in
          New Hampshire for this purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>C. Severability -</strong> If one or more provisions of this
          Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable law, the
          parties agree to renegotiate such provision in good faith. In the
          event that the parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and
          enforceable replacement for such provision, then (i) such provision
          shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the
          Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision were so excluded
          and (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be enforceable in
          accordance with its terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>D. No Waiver -</strong> Failure by us to act on or enforce any
          provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of that
          provision or any other provision in these Terms. No waiver shall be
          effective against CallSine unless made in writing, and no such waiver
          shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>E. Entire Agreement -</strong> Except as expressly agreed to
          in writing by CallSine, these Terms constitute the entire agreement
