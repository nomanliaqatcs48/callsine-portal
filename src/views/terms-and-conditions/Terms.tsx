      <p>
        <strong>18. Mediation Agreement and Class Action Waiver</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        A. Mandatory Mediation. YOU AND CALLSINE AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY AND ALL
        DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES (each, a
        "Dispute") to Mediation Non-Binding Mediation pursuant to the Federal
        Mediation Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), which shall govern
        the interpretation and enforcement of this Mediation agreement
        ("Mediation Agreement"). You and CallSine waive the right to a trial by
        jury and any right to have a Dispute heard in court. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, both you and CallSine retain the right to bring an individual
        action in small claims court (if your claims qualify and so long as the
        matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual
        (non-class, non-representative) basis) and the right to seek injunctive
        or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
        prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
        violation of either party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
        patents, or other intellectual property rights.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Mediation, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a
        judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the
        arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts. The
        arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief
        as a court, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and
        declaratory relief. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in
        any court having jurisdiction thereof. A single arbitrator with the
        American Mediation Association ("AAA") will conduct the Mediation, and
        the award may not exceed the relief allowed by applicable law. The
        Mediation will be conducted in the county of your residence or another
        mutually agreed location, provided that if the value of the relief
        sought is $10,000 or less, you or CallSine may elect to have the
        Mediation conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions,
        which election will be binding on you and CallSine, subject to the
        arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the
        circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you
        or CallSine may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires
        otherwise. The AAA's Consumer Mediation Rules will apply. If AAA will
        not apply those rules, then AAA's Commercial Mediation Rules will apply.
        The AAA's rules and a form that can be used to initiate Mediation
        proceedings are available at{" "}
        <a href="https://www.adr.org/">https://www.adr.org/</a>. You and
        CallSine agree that if for any reason AAA will not conduct or becomes
        unavailable to conduct the Mediation, then a court may appoint a
        substitute arbitrator, and further agree that the choice of AAA as a
        forum is not integral to the Mediation Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The arbitrator will decide all issues relating to the enforceability,
        interpretation, scope, and application of this Mediation Agreement
        (including "gateway" issues of arbitrability, whether the Mediation
        Agreement is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to Mediation),
        and these Terms, except that a court will resolve any question regarding
        the validity or enforceability of the class action waiver set forth in
        Section B of this Mediation Agreement. The term "Dispute" and the
        requirement to arbitrate will be broadly interpreted.
      </p>

      <p>
        B. Mediation Class Action Waiver. You and CallSine agree that the
        Mediation will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not on a
        class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general basis.
        A Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim brought or discovery by
        any person or entity that is not a party to the Mediation proceeding.
        The arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a
        party to the Mediation proceeding and may only award such relief as is
        necessary to provide relief to a party to the Mediation proceeding. If a
        court deems any portion of this Section B invalid or unenforceable, then
        Sections A and C of this Mediation Agreement will be null and void.
      </p>

      <p>
        C. Fees and Costs in Mediation. Payment of all filing, administration
        and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        D. Non-Mediation Class Action and Jury Waiver. You and CallSine agree
        that if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
        Mediation: (1) you and CallSine waive any right to a jury trial; (2) the
        Dispute will proceed solely on an individual, non-class,
        non-representative basis; and (3) neither you nor CallSine may be a
        class representative or class member or otherwise participate in any
        class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general
        proceeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        E. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS SECTION, YOU MAY
        CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY MEDIATION IF YOU OPT OUT
        OF THIS MEDIATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE EARLIER OF: (1) THE
        DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR (2) THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREED OR
        ASSENTED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH CALLSINE THAT CONTAINED AN MEDIATION
        PROVISION. The opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than the
        applicable deadline and mailed to: CallSine LLC, 44 Lafayette Rd., PO
        Box 263, North Hampton, NH 03862. The opt-out notice must state that you
        do not agree to this Mediation Agreement and must include your name,
        address, phone number and email address. This procedure is the only way
        you can opt out of this Mediation Agreement, and failure to comply
        strictly with this procedure and the applicable deadline automatically
        will render the opt-out notice null and void. If you opt out of the
        Mediation provision, all other parts of this Mediation Agreement will
        continue to apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>19. Notice -</strong> All notices in connection with these Terms
        will be given by regular mail (postage prepaid, return receipt

        <strong>20. Other Terms</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>A. Injunctive Relief -</strong> You agree and acknowledge that
        any access, use, disclosure, retention or other processing of CallSine
        Data in violation of these Terms may cause immediate and irreparable
        harm to CallSine for which money damages may not constitute an adequate
        remedy. Therefore, you agree that CallSine may obtain specific
        performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, in addition to its
        remedies at law. CallSine shall be entitled to such equitable relief in
        addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>B. Choice of Law and Venue -</strong> This Agreement, the right
        of the parties and all claims, actions, causes of action, suits,
        litigation, controversies, hearings, charges, complaints or proceedings
        arising in whole or in part under or in connection herewith, will be
        governed by and construed in accordance with the procedural and
        substantive laws of the State of New Hampshire, without giving effect to
        any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
        application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties agree
        that any action to enforce the provisions of this Agreement will take
        place in New Hampshire, and the parties expressly agree to submit to the
        jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in New Hampshire for this
        purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>C. Severability -</strong> If one or more provisions of this
        Agreement are held to be unenforceable under applicable law, the parties
        agree to renegotiate such provision in good faith. In the event that the
        parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement
        for such provision, then (i) such provision shall be excluded from this
        Agreement, (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if
        such provision were so excluded and (iii) the balance of the Agreement
        shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>D. No Waiver -</strong> Failure by us to act on or enforce any
        provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of that
        provision or any other provision in these Terms. No waiver shall be
        effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be
        construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>E. Entire Agreement -</strong> Except as expressly agreed to in
        writing by us, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between the
        parties with respect to the subject matter, and supersede all previous
        or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the
        parties with respect to the subject matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>F. Headings -</strong> The section headings are provided merely
        for convenience and must not be given any legal import. References to
        CallSine includes references to its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers,
        directors, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>G. Assignment -</strong> These Terms will inure to the benefit
        of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees. We may assign
        our rights or obligations without your consent. You may not assign or
        transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms (or your account)
        to anyone without our consent and any assignment or transfer in
        violation of this section is void.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>H. No Third-Party Beneficiary -</strong> These Terms do not
        create any third-party beneficiary rights to any person who is not a
        party.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I. Survival -</strong> Provisions of the Terms relating to
